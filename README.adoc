This is a set of Python code examples that I have worked on over the years.
Updated infrequently, and quite at random! Do a `git pull` every few months to keep up.
Contents are reasonably well predicted by the directory name:

* datetime
* database
* graphics
* gui - graphical user interfaces
* i18n - internationalization
* io
* iteration - the iterator protocol & friends
* lang - basic language stuff
* ml - machine learning
* numbers - numerics
* oo - Object Orientation
* otherlang - Dealing with other languages
* packaging - Should be called `modules` probably
* regex	- you need this.
* sidebyside - comparison with some other programming languages
* starting - getting started
* strings
* structure - collections / data structuring
* testing
* textproc
* www
* xml

There is also a `runall` script which tries to do what it says on the tin,
but may well need editing for your environment.
