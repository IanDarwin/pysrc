This is a set of Python code examples that I have worked on over the years.
Updated infrequently, and quite at random! Do a `git pull` every few months to keep up.
Contents are reasonably well predicted by the directory name:

* datetime
* db
* graphics
* gui
* io
* lang
* numbers
* oo - Object Orientation
* otherlang - Dealing with other languages
* packaging - Should be called `modules` probably
* regex	- you need this.
* starting
* strings
* structure
* testing
* textproc
* www
* xml

There is also `runall` which tries to do what its name implies,
but will likely need editing for your environment.
